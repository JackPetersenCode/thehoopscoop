🛠 Software Tools for Sports Bettors
If you want to build software tools for sports betting, here are some ideas:

1️⃣ AI-Based Odds Prediction Model
🔹 What It Does:

Uses machine learning to predict fair odds for each NBA game.
Compares sportsbook lines vs. fair odds to detect value bets.
🔹 Tech Stack:

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) for model training.
NBA API / Odds API (Scrape data from sportsbooks & game results).
Django / Flask for a web dashboard.
2️⃣ Line Movement Tracker (Sharp Money Detector)
🔹 What It Does:

Tracks real-time changes in sportsbook odds.
Alerts users when sportsbooks adjust odds due to sharp betting activity.
🔹 How It Helps Bettors:

If odds suddenly shift, it indicates insider information (e.g., injury, sharp money).
Bettors can tail sharp money before the line fully adjusts.
🔹 Tech Stack:

Web scraper (Selenium / BeautifulSoup) to monitor live sportsbook odds.
Real-time notification system (Twilio, Firebase, Telegram bot).
React + Python backend for a user dashboard.
