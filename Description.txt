 

My flagship portfolio project, www.hoopscoop.org, is a full-stack project originally written with React.js/JavaScript/Node.js/Express.js/Postgres, and I have recently re-vamped it with React.js/TypeScript/.NET/C#/Postgres. I read the NBA's API into CSV/JSON files, then into my own Postgres database and have created a massive custom NBA API of my own. This application features a Prop Bet Optimizer that displays the historical success rate of any prop for any player against any opponent. Users can also filter results further with the home/visitor option. (Check it out! www.hoopscoop.org). Users can also view shot charts for every player in any season or game. The 'Legacy Predictions' tool is my game prediction algorithm that has a 63.66% success rate over the last eight seasons. It displays upcoming games with expected scores and all historical results. Finally, the table at the bottom of the page utilizes advanced raw SQL queries to display advanced player stats. Users can filter/sort stats in countless ways, including player or lineups, opponent, home or away, per mode, and stat category (just like the actual NBA API).
